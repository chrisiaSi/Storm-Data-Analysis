# Storm-Data-Analysis
Explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer questions about severe weather events

The data analysis will address the following questions:

    
1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

    
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The report is written such that it can be read by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events. However, there are no specific recommendations in the report.
